# PC_Monitor
A PC Resource Monitor for Windows developed as part of a test given during an interview.

I usually do not put the executables on Github. But this one is an exception since it was only a temporary repository.

GET THE EXECUTABLE HERE - https://github.com/tanaydimri/PC_Monitor/blob/master/dist/
EXECUTABLE NAME - pc_monitor.exe

Please feel free to reach in case of any queries.
